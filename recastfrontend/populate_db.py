We select events with at least four jets, require pairs of dijets with equal mass, and search for pair production of new particles. We set upper limits on the product of the resonance cross section, branching fraction into dijets, and acceptance.

    description='Results of a search for decays of massive particles to fully hadronic final states are presented. This search uses 20.3 fb−1 of data collected by the ATLAS detector in √s = 8 TeV proton–proton collisions at the LHC. Signatures based on high jet multiplicities without requirements on the missing transverse momentum are used to search for R-parity-violating supersymmetric gluino pair production with subsequent decays to quarks. The analysis is performed using a requirement on the number of jets, in combination with separate requirements on the number of b-tagged jets, as well as a topological observable formed from the scalar sum of the mass values of large-radius jets in the event. Results are interpreted in the context of all possible branching ratios of direct gluino decays to various quark flavors. No significant deviation is observed from the expected Standard Model backgrounds estimated using jet-counting as well as data- driven templates of the total-jet-mass spectra. Gluino pair decays to ten or more quarks via intermediate neutralinos are excluded for a gluino with mass mg ̃ < 1 TeV for a neutralino mass mχ ̃01 = 500 GeV. Direct gluino decays to six quarks are excluded for mg ̃ < 917 GeV for light-flavor final states, and results for various flavor hypotheses are presented.',

In order to assess the general coverage of the search, it would be interesting to recast more topologies.

This adds to the tension between experiment and supersymmetric solutions of the naturalness problem, since the gluino is required to be light if the electroweak scale is to be natural. Here, we examine natural scenarios where supersymmetry is present, but was hidden from 2011 searches due to violation of $R$-parity and the absence of a large missing transverse momentum signature. Naturalness suggests that third generation states should dominate gluino decays and we argue that this leads to a generic signature in the form of same-sign, flavour-ambivalent leptons, without large missing transverse momentum. As a result, searches in this channel are able to cover a broad range of scenarios with some generality and one should seek gluinos that decay in this way with masses below a TeV. We encourage the LHC experiments to tailor a search for supersymmetry in this form. We consider a specific case that is good at hiding: baryon number violation. The only light sparticles are right-handed stops and gluinos. ',

The search is performed in a data sample corresponding to 1.6 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity collected in 2011 at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Muon pairs are selected by requiring two isolated muons of the same electric charge with pT > 20 GeV and abs(eta) < 2.5. Minimal requirements are placed on the rest of the event activity. The distribution of the invariant mass of the muon pair m(mumu) is found to agree well with the background expectation. Upper limits on the cross section for anomalous production of two muons with the same electric charge are placed as a function of m(mumu) within a fiducial region defined by the event selection. The fiducial cross- section limit constrains the like-sign top-quark pair-production cross section to be below 3.7 pb at 95% confidence level. The data are also analyzed to search for a narrow like-sign dimuon resonance as predicted for e.g. doubly charged Higgs bosons (H++/H--). Assuming pair production of H++/H-- bosons and a branching ratio to muons of 100% (33%), this analysis excludes masses below 355 (244) GeV and 251 (209) GeV for H++/H-- bosons coupling to left-handed and right-handed fermions, respectively.',

    reason_for_request='Gluinos that result in classic large missing transverse momentum signatures at the LHC have been excluded by 2011 searches if they are lighter than around 800 GeV. This adds to the tension between experiment and supersymmetric solutions of the naturalness problem, since the gluino is required to be light if the electroweak scale is to be natural. Here, we examine natural scenarios where supersymmetry is present, but was hidden from 2011 searches due to violation of $R$-parity and the absence of a large missing transverse momentum signature. Naturalness suggests that third generation states should dominate gluino decays and we argue that this leads to a generic signature in the form of same-sign, flavour-ambivalent leptons, without large missing transverse momentum. As a result, searches in this channel are able to cover a broad range of scenarios with some generality and one should seek gluinos that decay in this way with masses below a TeV. We encourage the LHC experiments to tailor a search for supersymmetry in this form. We consider a specific case that is good at hiding: baryon number violation. The only light sparticles are right-handed stops and gluinos. ',

No excess above the Standard Model background expectation is observed in 1.04 fb^-1 of data. Gluino and squark masses below 700 GeV and 875 GeV respectively are excluded at the 95% confidence level in simplified models containing only squarks of the first two generations, a gluino octet and a massless neutralino. The exclusion limit increases to 1075 GeV for squarks and gluinos of equal mass. In MSUGRA/CMSSM models with tan(beta)=10, A_0=0 and mu> 0, squarks and gluinos of equal mass are excluded for masses below 950 GeV. These limits extend the region of supersymmetric parameter space excluded by previous measurements.',

Gluino -> higgsino decays, through off-shell stops and sbottoms, are an example.

However, the limits should be greatly reduced if the spectrum is altered by including an intermediate particle in the decay chain. In this simplified model, only light flavor squarks are accessible and the gluinos are decoupled, and thus the main production mode is squark-antisquark pair-production. The squarks now decay to an intermediate particle, to a chargino/wino triplet, plus a jet. The chargino/wino then decays to a vector boson and a neutral state. This scenario can occur in the MSSM where the right handed squarks are decoupled from the left-handed ones, and in the NMSSM where the LSP is a singlino.
